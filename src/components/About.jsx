        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Ashlea Morgan, scientist and writer. As a doctoral candidate in Neurobiology & Behavior at Columbia University, I study how neural signaling drives our ability to regulate emotions and behave flexibly. As a writer, I compose articles on scientific research for both scientific and general audiences and integrate those stories into other topics involving what makes us who we are.</p>
