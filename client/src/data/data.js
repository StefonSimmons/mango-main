    description: 'In the last two decades, remarkable advances have been made in 3D culture technology. Using embryonic or adult mammalian stem cells, researchers worked to achieve functional tissue-like structures called organoids. Researchers discussed recent progress during a symposium at the New York Academy of Science on November 12, 2019.',

  'We are constantly updating information from our worlds - both within and outside of us. As our environment changes, we use this information to adapt. But, how?',

  'Nerve cells use chemical signals called neurotransmitters(e.g.serotonin) to communicate.Serotonin is well - known for its role in depression but is used to communicate throughout the gut and brain, including the medial prefrontal cortex.This area of the brain is vital for higher - order functions like anticipating, decision making, regulating emotion, and thinking flexibly.',

  'I study how serotonin signaling in a region of the medial prefrontal cortex is driving emotional regulation and cognitive flexibility, thus altering behavior.'
