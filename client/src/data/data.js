    description: 'Cognitive flexibility, in its simplest form, is the ability to think about more than one concept simultaneously. Critically, however, we rely on our ability to not only consider two or more concepts but also switch between these concepts and adapt our behavior based on what’s happening around us. Throughout my doctoral research, I’ve investigated how a chemical called serotonin is involved in this ability.',

  'We are constantly updating information from our worlds - both within and outside of us. As our environment changes, we use this information to adapt. But, how?',

  'Nerve cells use chemical signals called neurotransmitters (e.g. serotonin) to communicate. Serotonin is well-known for its role in depression but is used to communicate throughout the gut and brain, including the medial prefrontal cortex. This area of the brain is vital for higher-order functions like anticipating, decision making, regulating emotion, and thinking flexibly.',

  'I study how serotonin signaling in a region of the medial prefrontal cortex is driving emotional regulation and cognitive flexibility, thus altering behavior.'
